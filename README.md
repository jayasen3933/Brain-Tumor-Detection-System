#  Brain Tumor Classification Using Deep Learning

##  Overview
This project focuses on the classification of brain tumors from MRI scans using advanced deep learning techniques. The goal is to assist healthcare professionals in the early detection and diagnosis of brain tumors. The project uses transfer learning with the pre-trained **Xception model** and a custom-built **Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)** to classify MRI images into four categories:

- Glioma
- Meningioma
- Pituitary
- No Tumor

An interactive **Streamlit** web app has been developed to allow users to upload MRI scans and receive predictions along with visual explanations.
